In short words the water is hidden even in our thoughts. <br><br>Of this 71%:  97% is salt (oceans) and the remaining 3% (drinkable) distribute it in:     Agriculture 70%  - 22% industry - 8% to cover our basic needs. <br><br>100 years ago, big cities like Rotterdam, London, Montereal, Paris, New York, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong were centers infectious diseases. The death rate in children was the same that exists today in Africa. In general, water and sanitation reforms were those that allowed humans to progress forward.</p>
