				<li><p class="text-justify"><strong>b. Donations</strong><br>As an organization with a different way of fundraising, InternationalRavers.org  is required to be structured in a way that would sustain each dollar  that we recieved and  invested, inside and outside our organization. That´s why we have created two aid programs (1) Water accessibility program, and (2) Sanitation and hygiene program. <br>However, internationalravers.org has 3 different ways to donate.</p>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
						<li><p class="text-justify">(1) By a normal donation:  It is called so, because it offers the most common way to donate to any website. This form of donation will be exclusively for our sanitation and hygiene program "Help a Warrior", which transfers them strictly funds to finance projects of sanitation and hygiene.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The minimum donation is $ 1.00 dollar.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The maximum donation is $ 999,999.00 dollars.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">You are able to donate once or monthly.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">To subscribe to a monthly donation the minimum amount is $ 4 dollars.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
						<li><p class="text-justify">(2)  By a Kandi Trade, This is our most original way to raise funds for our water accessibility program. This initiative have a lot of sense with what we live today, both in our day as at EDM festivals or clubs  we attended.  Doing  a Kandi Trade, you will donate the same amount of water you drank in your last EDM event. This way of fundraising is simple and original and is strictly regulated by InternationalRavers.org. The restrictions of this type of donation are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p class="text-justify">You can only enter one event at a time.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">You can donate  from 1 day to 21 days (according to our calendar of EDM events, EDM nightclubs is 1 night, but in case of an EDM festival can range from 1 to 21 days).</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The maximum amount of water consumed by a festival goer (raver) is 3.7 liters of water on average. For this reason it is impossible for our system allows you to donate more than 4 liters. per day.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The minimum amount of water allowed to donate per day is 2 liters.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The minimum donation per liter of water consumed is $ 0.5 cents.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The maximum donation that you are able to donate  (no matter how many days or liters of  water you drank) cannot exceed $ 999,999.00 dollars.</p></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
						<li><p class="text-justify">(3) Gift a donation to your favorite DJ on its Birthday, The restrictions that you have to help your DJ to achieve the goal: either put filters in schools or wells to draw water to communities in developing countries, are almost nil.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p class="text-justify">You can donate from $ 1.00.</p></li>
								<li><p class="text-justify">The maximum donation is $ 999,999.00 dollars, per donor. (In this case the amount rised by the DJ have no limits).</p></li>
